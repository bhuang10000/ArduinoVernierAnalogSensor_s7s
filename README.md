Arduino Code for Vernier Analog Sensors to 2 Serial 7 Segment Displays
===============

These are a series of sketches to interface the Vernier Analog sensors directly 
through their BTA connector. This connector can be purchased directly through 
Vernier as Part Number BTA-ELV -- http://www.vernier.com/products/accessories/bta-elv/

SparkFun Electronics will be carrying a Vernier Sensor Shield soon. The release date is still
pending. In the meantime, this code can be tested and run using the BTA-ELV and an Arduino.
